got consumer secret and key

1.5) DONE 
Take the repeated logic of src\app\api\auth\user\request_token\route.ts line 20, and make it into a reusable function/class/whatever

2) Remove fetch calls and replace with useQuery hooks

3) Move filter stuff to the side not below

4) NEST DASHBOARD/RANDOM INTO ONE DIR TO CONSOLIDATE LAYOUT


5) Standardize the ApiResponse, so instead of "successMessage" and "errorMessage", it's just an array of "messages", and each is a json object with "success" field as boolean, and content as message. Parse and display as toasts
- add a helper that takes in an ApiResponse, and detects whether there is a "messages" or not in it, then displays the toasts
