# **_deepcuts._**

This website will add functionality I feel was always missing from Discogs, a randomizer!  
Looking for the next obscure album or gem to uncover?  
Or maybe just trying to find that next record to play?  
Don't even know where to start?

Introducing **_deepcuts._**

> This randomizer works off all releases, not just the master release!  
> So even if a release does not have a master release, it will still populate here!

#### Future implentations include.......

> -   filters ,
> -   a favorites/bookmark/history feature ,
> -   a tested user login/signup ,
> -   user profile screens ,
> -   a hashing function for passwords and added security ,
> -   maybe a confirmation email upon sign up for verification ,
> -   more randomizers based on MRIs/Artists/Labels ,
> -   maybe Discogs account integration to be able to add to wantlist directly from here ,
> -   improved UI and optimized performance ,
> -   and hopefully many more before eventual deployment !

Built utilizing Next.js, Prisma ORM, and a PostgreSQL DB.

Thank you for joining me on this journey (:
