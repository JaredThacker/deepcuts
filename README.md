# **_deepcuts._**

This website will add functionality I feel was always missing from Discogs, a randomizer!  
Looking for the next obscure album or gem to uncover?  
Or maybe just trying to find that next record to play?  
Don't even know where to start?

Introducing **_deepcuts._**

> This randomizer works off all releases, not just the master release!  
> So even if a release does not have a master release, it will still populate here!

#### Future implentations include.......

> -   filters ,
> -   a favorites/bookmark/history feature ,
> -   sessions ,
> -   user profile screens ,
> -   more randomizers based on MRIs/Artists/Labels ,
> -   maybe Discogs account integration to be able to add to wantlist directly from here ,
> -   improved UI and optimized performance ,
> -   and hopefully many more before eventual deployment !

## How It Looks..... (so far)

1. Landing page is a screen where you can either create an account, or login with an existing one. (Still need to implement sessions fully)

2. After logging in, it will automatically redirect you to the dashboard

3. Now just press the randomize button until you find something that piques your interest! Also, upon pressing the artwork, it will redirect you to discogs official page for that release!

Built utilizing Next.js, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL.
