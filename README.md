# <ins>**_deepcuts_**</ins> : ~~a discogs random generator~~

This website will add functionality I feel was always missing from Discogs, a randomizer!  
Looking for the next obscure album or gem to uncover?  
Or maybe just trying to find that next record to play?  
Don't even know where to start?  
Introducing deepcuts.

This randomizer works off all releases, not just the master release!  
So even if a release does not have a master release, it will still populate here!

Future implentations include filters and a user login,  
Maybe even more randomizers based on MRIs/Artists/Labels,  
Discogs account login to be able to add to wantlist directly from here,  
A favorites/bookmark/history feature,  
Improved UI and optimized performance,

And of course eventual deployment!

Thank you for joining me on this journey (:
